## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:

df2 = df.groupBy('Call Type Group').count()
graphDF = df2.toPandas()
graphDF = graphDF.sort_values('count', ascending=False)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
graphDF.plot(x='Call Type Group', y = 'count', kind='bar')
plt.title('Call Type Group by Count')
plt.show()


**Following is what you need for this book:**
If youâ€™re looking for a practical and highly useful resource for implementing efficiently distributed deep learning models with Apache Spark, then the Apache Spark Deep Learning Cookbook is for you. Knowledge of the core machine learning concepts and a basic understanding of the Apache Spark framework is required to get the best out of this book. Additionally, some programming knowledge in Python is a plus.
